Installation

Undockerized

1. Clone the repo
   git clone
   cd filterapp
2. Build
   mvn clean package
   This produces `target/filterapp.jar`.

Dockerized

1. Clone the repo
   git clone
   cd filterapp
2. Build Docker image
   docker build -t myteam/filterapp\:latest .

---

Usage

Undockerized

1. Ensure your X11 server is running

   * On Windows, start Xming/VcXsrv and allow connections.
   * On Linux/macOS, ensure `DISPLAY` is set:
     export DISPLAY=:0
     xhost +  (if needed)
2. Run the JAR
   java -jar target/filterapp.jar
3. Select an image or video via the GUI and choose sequential or parallel processing.

Dockerized

Linux / macOS

docker run --rm&#x20;
-e DISPLAY=\$DISPLAY&#x20;
-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix&#x20;
-v "\$(pwd)":/project&#x20;
myteam/filterapp\:latest

Windows (PowerShell)

1. Start your X server (e.g., Xming).

2. In PowerShell:

   docker run --rm `  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`
   -e DISPLAY=\$Env\:DISPLAY `  -v "C:/path/to/filterapp":/project`
   myteam/filterapp\:latest

3. The GUI should open through your X server.

---

Troubleshooting

* Canâ€™t connect to X11 window server

  * Ensure your X server is running and listening on the correct display.
  * On Windows, verify `DISPLAY` matches your X server setting (usually `host.docker.internal:0`).
  * On Linux/macOS, you may need `xhost +` to allow connections.

* Invalid Docker reference format

  * Check that your volume paths use forward slashes or proper quoting.
  * Example Windows path: `-v "C:/path/to/project":/project`
